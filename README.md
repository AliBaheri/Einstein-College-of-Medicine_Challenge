# Einstein College of Medicine ML Challenge:

### Overall:


### Data:
Original data: [Citibike Monthly Trip Data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html).
I preprocessed data such that the inputs of our algorithms are `Time` and `Location ID`, and the outputs are
`# of bike in` and `# of bike out`.


### Objective:
Build a machine learning model to predict the number of riders per hour for an entire month using the previous 6 months data.


### Methods:
